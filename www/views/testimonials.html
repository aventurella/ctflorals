                            <p class="item">She was able to incorporate the beautiful landscape with the bright/happy palate we wanted for our big day. She made sure every detail was perfect from the boutonnieres and ceremony site to the specially handcrafted outfit for our flower dog.</p>
                            <p class="item">Our flowers were such a hit that our pictures made it on to the Ruffled Blog which you can see at: <a href="http://ruffledblog.com/vintage-new-mexico-wedding">http://ruffledblog.com/vintage-new-mexico-wedding</a>. Catherine is a true artist and very open to each bride's individual vision. I would highly recommend her.</p>

They were so creative and photographed beautifully &ndash; much more than just pretty background elements. And they made our wedding truly shine. I can't imagine that day being as special without them. She listened, then gave us something above and beyond what we expected, but still very 'us.'</p>

She became more than my florist &ndash; she became my fairy god mother. I told her my colors, my concepts, my fantasies, and my budget. She took it from there and made my wedding day more than anything I could imagine.</p>
